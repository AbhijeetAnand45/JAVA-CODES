# JAVA-CODES

## Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

## In this repository I will add the programs related to java programming from basic to advance.

1. Hello world with java
2. Addition of two number in java with input from user.
3. If else in java with leap year problem.
4. Method overloading combined program for both varying in data type as well as no. of argument.
5. Constructor overloading Example.
6. Program to solve Quadratic Equation by taking input a,b,c as ax^2 + bx + c where a is not zero and print all the real solution.
7. Find sum of natural number between a and b using recursion.
8. Find Fibonacci series with recursion.
9. Program to check prime Number
PELIDROME NUMBER IS A NUMBER WHICH IS SAME AFTER REVERSSING IT.
10. Program to check pelidrome Number.
11. Printing patterns : One can esily gets the codes of various types of pattern from here.
12. Armstrong Number in Java: A positive number is called armstrong number if it is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. for example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407 etc.
13. prints the ASCII value (0 to 255) of all the characters.

14. Write a program that creates a user interface to perform integer addition.The user enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2.
- The addition of Num1 and Num2 is displayed in the Result field when the ADD button is clicked.
- */ Use jdk 1.8 version and give command javac integeraddition.java to compile the program  and give command appletviewer integeraddition.java to view the result in the applet viewer */
15. Write a program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The userenters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program would throw Number Format Exception. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throwan Arithmetic Exception Display the exception in a message dialog box.
- */ Use jdk 1.8 version and give command "javac integeraddition.java" to compile the program 
    and give command "appletviewer integeraddition.java" to view the result in the applet viewer */
16. Develop an applet that displays a simple message.
17. Develop an applet that creates choice control from a simple list containing 5 items.
18. Develop an applet that receives an integer in one text field and computes its factorial value <br> Return its result value in another text field when the button named compute is clicked. 

# pattern problems
## Here you  will also get  pattern Problem which helps to understand nested for loop and develop logical thinking : 

- You have to go through code to understand Each pattern
