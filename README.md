# JAVA-Programming 

## About

-  Java is a programming language. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
- This Repository is all about learning basics of Programming in Java.


## Setup 

- install java in your system.
- fork this repository and then go to your respository and copy the link(in right corner) to clone it.

- give the command in your terminal :- 
` git clone https://github.com/[YourUserName]/JAVA-CODES.git `

- open it in your editor (Preferred vs code) , create a new branch in terminal of the same directory And add new files ex - Sample.java and write some code and run it using command `javac Sample.java` for compile and `java Sample` to run the program. (In doing all this , make sure you are always in right directory).
-  Then push your code to github , finally make a pull request to make your first contribution to open source.

3. If else in java with leap year problem.
4. Method overloading combined program for both varying in data type as well as no. of argument.
5. Constructor overloading Example.
6. Program to solve Quadratic Equation by taking input a,b,c as ax^2 + bx + c where a is not zero and print all the real solution.
7. Find sum of natural number between a and b using recursion.
8. Find Fibonacci series with recursion.
9. Program to check prime Number

10. Program to check pelidrome Number.
11. Printing patterns : One can esily gets the codes of various types of pattern from here.
12. Armstrong Number in Java: A positive number is called armstrong number if it is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. for example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407 etc.
13. prints the ASCII value (0 to 255) of all the characters.

14. Write a program that creates a user interface to perform integer addition.The user enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2.
    * The addition of Num1 and Num2 is displayed in the Result field when the ADD button is clicked.
    * Use jdk 1.8 version and give command javac integeraddition.java to compile the program  and give command appletviewer integeraddition.java to view the result in the applet viewer.
15. Write a program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The userenters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program would throw Number Format Exception. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throwan Arithmetic Exception Display the exception in a message dialog box.
    * Use jdk 1.8 version and give command "javac integeraddition.java" to compile the program and give command "appletviewer integeraddition.java" to view the result in the applet viewer.

`javac programName.java `  to compile the code
`appletviewer programName.java`  to view in applet
 


16. Develop an applet that displays a simple message.
17. Develop an applet that creates choice control from a simple list containing 5 items.
18. Develop an applet that receives an integer in one text field and computes its factorial value <br> Return its result value in another text field when the button named compute is clicked.
